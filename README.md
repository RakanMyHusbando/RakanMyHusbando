## About Me

My journey into tech began with my grandfather, a hardware enthusiast, who taught me how to solder power supplies and microcontroller projects. He suggested that I start programming with a hardware-oriented language, so the very first programming language I learned was Assembly (though I probably couldn't write much in it today).

Most of my free time is spent with my own programming projects, exploring new Linux distributions or configuring window managers and customizing my system. Right now, I'm running **Gentoo** with **OpenRC** and **Hyprland** as my window manager on my PC and **Arch Linux** with **System D** and **Hyprland** as window manager on my Laptop.
